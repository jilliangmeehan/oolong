Inspired by [Anh's meta page](https://anhvn.com/meta/).

This is a personal project to re-do my website from scratch with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), learning as I go. My primary goal is to end up with a website I'm happy with. My secondary goal is to fall back in love with the process.

I named this project **oolong**, after my favorite type of tea. Oolong is a partially-oxidized tea, falling between a black & a green tea. There's a legend that it was discovered by accident, by a man who forgot about his tea because he got distracted by a deer.

I like the idea of oolong representing an in-between state — a website that’s not too light, but not too serious. I also like the idea of "brewing" a website to your taste: having different themes, things to play around with, and places to leave notes. I want it to feel comfortable & lived-in, as well as intimate & welcoming, like someone's living room. or a small teashop.
