## two-week sleepover
One of my best friends is coming to visit & stay with me for a couple of weeks, and it's gonna be a great time. We have lots of plans to play video games together and rewatch our favorite k-dramas. 

## learning greek
I just finished Section 1: Unit 9 of the [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/jilliangmeehan) Greek course this morning! Onto the next. I've also been practicing my Greek handwriting this week on pages in the back of my Hobonichi journal — it's like educational doodling. 

## playing
### [Honkai Star Rail](/shelf/games/hsr/)
*Very* into the 3.0 update. The Herta is great & very fun to play, Amphoreus is lovely, and I'm really excited about this chapter of the story so far. Penacony was great, but I can already tell this will be better.

I've also been spending a lot of time grinding through the past Simulated Universe expansions, since I never really finished them. I unlocked all the secrets in Swarm Disaster and Unknowable Domain, and now I'm working on Gold & Gears.

## balatro
Have been getting back into Balatro a bit this week, since it's a really good Steam Deck game. I am *not* very good at it, but it's such a fun way to lose a few hours on the couch.

## The other gachas
I've really just been playing a *lot* of HSR this week, so my other games — [Genshin](/shelf/games/genshin), [ZZZ](/shelf/games/zzz), and [Wuthering Waves](/shelf/games/wuwa) — have taken a bit of a backseat. But there's a new ZZZ update coming up soon that I'm excited about, and it's almost time for Lantern Rite in Genshin!
