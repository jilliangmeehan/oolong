Two days until work starts up again — at this point I'm grateful for it, because I think I really need to just get back into my normal routines. And to remember that time flows normally even after vacation ends, because my brain keeps tricking me into thinking that I need to do *everything* I've *ever* wanted to do before Monday or I will run out of time and lose the chance to do any of it ever again. Silly!

## what i've been up to
I went home to see my family for Christmas; had a good time hanging out there for the week eating cookies and playing Uno. I came back to Brooklyn to see friends and make New Year's Even plans — which turned out to be very chill. Dylan and I hung out with a small group of friends and drank wine while we played video games until midnight. 

## reading
I spent an entire day reading [500 Years Later: An Oral History of Final Fantasy VII](https://readonlymemory.com/shop/book/500-years-2nd-edition/), which was pretty cool. It was less about the game itself and more about the business & management stuff happening at Square at the time, told through interviews with a bunch of the people involved before, during, and after the game launched. Really made me want to go back and play more of it! 

I also just got a copy of [The Norse Myths](https://50wattsbooks.com/products/the-norse-myths-the-pantheon-fairy-tale-and-folklore-library) retold by Kevin Crossley-Holland, and I've been making my way through it. I like having a bunch of these stories in a collection together that I can flip through, and there's a lot of extra context in the introduction & the footnotes for each story, so I'm learning a lot. 50 Watts has a bunch of other collections in the same ["Pantheon Fairy Tale and Folklore Library"](https://50wattsbooks.com/search?q=pantheon+folk) series, and I'd like to pick up more of them once I finish this one.

## watching
I didn't watch any Christmas movies this year! I always kinda forget to when I'm not with my family, and they watch them all early anyway. I'm in the mood for a Phantom Thread rewatch soon, though — it's a holiday movie in my heart if not in reality. 

My family and I usually like to watch comedy specials on Netflix when I'm home. This year we went for the newest Nate Bargatze one, and a couple of Tom Papa's. And when I got back to New York, Dylan and I started watching the new season of Squid Game, which we're a few episodes into so far.

## playing
Both [Genshin](/shelf/games/genshin/) and [Wuthering Waves](/shelf/games/wuwa/) had updates this week, and [Honkai Star Rail](/shelf/games/hsr/) has a big update coming up soon, so I've naturally been playing a lot of those. I'm also still playing a lot of [Kingdom: Two Crowns](/shelf/games/twocrowns/) — I finished the Call of Olympus DLC and started Norse Lands, to go along with the book I'm reading.

The big news is I just realized I can play Dragon's Dogma 2 again, after not being able to get it to open for months. It's not really a great time to sink my teeth back into a game like that, because I've got plenty of other things I wanted to do, but I can't help myself. I'm going to try to remember how the controls work today so I can pick up where I left off with the main story. 

## footnote
I'm happy with the changes I made to my[ /now](/now) page recently, and I'm happy to actually be updating it & writing weeknotes more often, but it does feel a little silly to me that I'm essentially writing the same thing in two places at the same time. They're not *exactly* the same, but there's a good amount of overlap. I don't know what I wanna do about that...or if I really care to do anything about it at all. Maybe it's fine! Whatever!
