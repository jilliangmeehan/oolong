![September recap from Retro.app](./photos/september_recap.png)

## things i did
- Got COVID for the first timeâ€‰â€”â€‰I missed a whole week of work laying around and being sick. Not too bad, but very boring since mostly I was too exhausted and dizzy to do anything but watch Youtube videos for hours while I marinated in Dayquil.
- Went to a wedding upstate with Dylan when the leaves were just starting to change ðŸ˜Œ
- Got a new iPhone for the first time in years. Orange phone good. 
- Started playing [Hades II](https://jillian.garden/shelf/games/hades/)
