hi i guess. it's been a while since i did any kind of bloggingâ€”i don't really know how to begin. 

i started reading the iliad last night & got very worked up at nearly 3 a.m. about the fact that i was reading a story that people were enjoying ~2700 years ago. so many things feel ephemeralâ€”how many people are downloading their twitter archive right now for fear of their tweets being lost? (and will they ever even look at it?)â€”but somehow i can read a story on my ipad that's so old we barely know anything about the origin of it. what? ok.

i don't think i ever want to make something that lasts that long. i don't think that i could, anyway. i'm content to tinker away at my little ideas & projects without the threat of longevity. 

when i was a kid using the family computer in the basement, i used to have bookmark folders of blogs & websites i liked, and i'd check them every so often to see what was new. it's hilarious to me to think of a time where i didn't rely on feeds. **anyway:** if you want, you can keep up with my posts here via [rss](https://jillian.garden/feed.rss). if you're more of a newsletter person, there are a bunch of rss-to-email services out thereâ€”[feedrabbit](https://feedrabbit.com) is one with a decent free tier.
