happy [dead week](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/12/christmas-new-years-dead-week-romjul/621098/). 
## what i'm up to
i started the greek [duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/jilliangmeehan) course this week. while i'm not particularly good at keeping my duolingo streak, i *do* like to pick up new courses every once in a while to see what's up — i mainly focus on learning mandarin, but i've started at least five others just for fun. 

i just find it really interesting to check out the beginning of different courses, especially when there's another alphabet involved — regardless of how much greek or korean i ever end up learning in my life, i think there's something to be said for having a basic understanding of how their alphabets work & how to pronounce things. 

i also, as you [may have already seen](https://jillian.garden/122623), started slowly rebuilding my website from scratch. and i'm having fun.
### reading
i finally got a copy of emily wilson's new translation of [the iliad](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-iliad-homer/17147944?ean=9781324001805) and have been slowly making my way through her (fantastic, imo) introduction. i also spent christmas morning reading bryan doerries' translation of ajax in [all that you've seen here is god](https://bookshop.org/p/books/all-that-you-ve-seen-here-is-god-new-versions-of-four-greek-tragedies-sophocles-ajax-philoctetes-women-of-trachis-aeschylus-prometheus-bound-sophocles/9802252?ean=9780307949738), which i loved. i'm excited to read the rest of the plays in this collection.

### playing
a year after i originally started playing ffxiv, i'm finally about to finish the seventh umbral era quests. i also recently got an analogue pocket (!!!) and have been playing castlevania: circle of the moon & fire emblem: the binding blade — both for the first time.

i picked up [roadwarden](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1155970/Roadwarden/) from the steam winter sale and then played it for four hours straight until i had a headache from reading a lot of tiny video game text on my steam deck in the dark without moving. it's so good.
### watching
i saw [napoleon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13287846/) a few weeks ago — i wish it had committed more to being one of the several different movies it was trying to be all at once. to make up for it, i really want to find time to see [maestro](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5535276/) & [the boy and the heron](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6587046/) sometime soon.

i haven't really been watching any new tv shows, but i did decide (after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-piNPoWoYc&pp=ygULZHJldyBnb29kZW4%3D)) that i want to watch [andor](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9253284/). i've also been hearing a lot about doctor who again lately, which is kind of making me want to get back into it.
