i haven't really touched [my website](https://jillian.cloud) in a long time. there are cobwebs in the corners, and i'm not even sure i remember how jekyll works anymore. so i'm starting from scratch, learning 11ty as i go, and hoping to fall back in love with the process while i make a new website.

i've been calling this project *oolong*, after my favorite type of tea, to represent the in-between-ness — a partially-oxidized website. just for fun, i've been thinking of each bit of work as a step in the tea-making process, reflected in the names of [my kanban columns](https://github.com/users/jilliangmeehan/projects/1/views/1):

🌱 plant the leaves → `backlog`

🍃 harvest the leaves → `on deck`

☀ oxidize the leaves → `in progress: building`

🫖 brew the tea → `in progress: styling`

🍵 serve the tea → `completed`

progress is slow, intentionally. there are [a few pages](https://ooolong.netlify.app/) to look at, at least. and a [changelog](https://ooolong.netlify.app/log/) that i want to update as i work on it. my first update says:

> feeling good about this so far. i've had fun setting up the github project & planning out what i want to do. i want to keep everything as simple as possible for as long as i can, because it's all too easy for me to get myself bogged down with page templates and sass before i even have anything to work with.
