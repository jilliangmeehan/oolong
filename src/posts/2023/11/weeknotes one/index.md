I'm going to copy [Anh](https://anhvn.com/posts/2023/weeknotes-revival/) — I've been thinking about [weeknotes](https://interconnected.org/home/2018/07/24/weeknotes) lately, and about why I don't write here very often, and about how I could change that. It's easier not to write than to write, and writing in public is a little humiliating in a way that private journaling escapes. But I've managed to build up the habit of journaling, so maybe I can do this, too.

I go back and forth on this: I sometimes feel annoying and useless taking up space "[on-line](https://sleepy.cool/@jillian/111387332195020722)," like I'm whining and begging everyone to *look at me! I'm here!* — like the only way I'm allowed to post is to share something interesting I worked on, and the rest of me has to live in the shadows. 

But I know that's not true. I know that I like to fill my feeds with tiny life updates and silly thoughts from people I follow, even people that I barely know at all. I love when [I have no idea what anyone is talking about](https://sleepy.cool/@jillian/111356009288566081). I love browsing [ooh.directory](https://ooh.directory/) for blogs I never would have known existed, and filling my rss feed with inconsequential posts that nonetheless make me happy to read. I want more of that, so maybe I have to be part of making more of that. 

## what i've been up to
I've been sketching more — in an actual sketchbook, with actual pens and pencils. I like doodling in Procreate, but something about sketching on paper feels better. Even though it's harder to correct things I'm not happy with, and even though I have far less freedom & flexibility with materials, I like what I make in my sketchbook far more than anything I make on my iPad.

Because of that, and because we're nearing the end of the year, I've been thinking a lot about notebooks and planners. I still haven't decided if I want a new Hobonichi for next year or if I want to try something else. I really don't need a planner, much less a daily one, but I still *like* having them. I do have some idea of what my ideal notebook would be, and the modularity of [the Traveler's Notebook](https://travelerscompanyusa.com/travelers-notebook-story/) comes pretty close — so I might try that out.

## watching
After years of curiosity, I started watching [Outlander](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3006802/) on Halloween — which was kind of perfect, because the first episode takes place on Samhain. I immediately loved the vibes. I've watched about half of the first season, and I'll probably continue watching it for a bit, but I don't know if i'll be able to hang on for seven seasons.

I also saw [The Killer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1136617/), which I didn't think was very good. It definitely looked & felt & sounded like a Fincher movie, but the story was lacking compared to everything else he's done. I would rather just rewatch The Social Network for the 300th time.

## playing
Genshin's 4.2 patch just came out, and I stayed up embarrassingly late to play the entire Archon Quest in one night after pulling for Furina and her weapon. I've *really* loved the whole Fontaine arc, and I think Act V wrapped it up so well — Furina is easily my favorite archon.

And to brag for a second: I managed to get 100% exploration on the existing Fontaine map before 4.2 was released, I got the Fontaine wings, and I also finally hit 1000 achievements this week. I have really played a stupid amount of this game.

As for the other Hoyoverse games, I finished the latest Trailblaze Mission in Honkai: Star Rail last night, just a few days away from a new update. And I finally started Honkai Impact: 3rd this week — so far, I have no idea what I'm doing, but the story is really interesting to me. I wanna know the lore!!!

## reading
I just reread Sophocles' [Ajax](https://classics.domains.skidmore.edu/lit-campus-only/primary/translations/Sophocles%20Ajax.pdf), a play I never expected to love as much as I do. I feel like every time I read it, I get something new out of it.

[An issue of Spencer Chang's newsletter](https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/believing-in-believing-in-people) from all the way back in February made its way into my queue recently, and I really loved reading it. Makes me want to be a more curious, friendly, open person.

I've also been thinking + reading a lot about chess lore recently:
- [chess in literature](https://bookriot.com/chess-in-literature/)
- [chess, unlike war, is a game of perfect information](https://daily.jstor.org/chess-unlike-war-is-a-game-of-perfect-information/)
- [the development of the chess motif in victorian fiction](https://victorianweb.org/authors/bronte/abronte/chess.html)
- [the symbolism of chess](http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/public/articles/The_Symbolism_of_Chess-by_Titus_Burckhardt.aspx)
- [scash d'armor](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/chess-equipment/scash-darmor-english-translation)

That's all. Happy Friday. Going to go make another cup of tea and clean my apartment.
