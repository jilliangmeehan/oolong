i did some other stuff too, but the fonts are the fun part. as mentioned in the [changelog](/log), i finally got around to sprucing up the place a little bit — i was getting tired of looking at a css-less website. 

![the before shot](./photos/before.png)

as the first step of that process, i treated myself to two connary fagen fonts that i've had stashed away in a folder for a while: [argent pixel](https://connary.com/argentpixel.html) & [addington](https://connary.com/addington.html). once i got those all set up, i stole andy bell's [css reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/) to get me started. and then i wrote some very lazy, scuffed css just to quickly get everything looking a *little* nicer.

i do have aspirations of really nice, clean, efficient scss. files that are organized and easy to read. but i decided when i started this project that it wasn't worth getting into the weeds with all that before i've had the chance to play around and actually figure out what i want the website to be. i'm still in the messy, experimental phase.

oh — i also (as mentioned in [the last post](https://ooolong.netlify.app/posts/2024/03/using%20obsidian%20as%20a%20cms/)) got some more collections set up in obsidian. so now i can make really quick updates to the [/now](/now) page by adding & editing obsidian files for books i'm reading, games i'm playing, and other things i'm doing. 

next, i think i want to set up individual pages for each item in those collections — each book, each game. and maybe a "shelf," so i can also list the things i've already finished or haven't started yet. and then maybe after that i'll get around to writing better css.
