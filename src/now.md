## celebrating six years

my six-year anniversary of moving to new york & joining [lickability](https://lickability.com) is coming up soon. i'm still in new york (living in brooklyn with my cat, juniper) and i'm still at lickability (as a project manager) and i'm still having a great time.

## reading

### [emily wilson's translation of the iliad](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-iliad-homer/17147944?ean=9781324001805)

i've been looking forward to the release of this, and my parents got me a copy for christmas so i can finally read it. (i got her translation of the odyssey, too, but i'm going to save that one for later.) so far, i'm still making my way through her introduction & i'm excited to spend a lot of time with this.

### [all that you've seen here is god](https://bookshop.org/p/books/all-that-you-ve-seen-here-is-god-new-versions-of-four-greek-tragedies-sophocles-ajax-philoctetes-women-of-trachis-aeschylus-prometheus-bound-sophocles/9802252?ean=9780307949738)

i've been very into sophocles' _ajax_ lately since i first read it earlier this year. i've just been rereading the same pdf i found online after a quick google, so having a different & very well-considered version to read is nice. i spent christmas morning reading this _ajax_ and crying, lol.

i haven't read the other plays included here, but i'm excited to. i'm very interested in what bryan doerries does with his translations & the [theater of war](https://theaterofwar.com/) project.

## playing

### genshin impact

this is nothing new. i'm always playing genshin. i pulled for navia (and her signature weapon) recently & i love her so much.

### ffxiv

finally got back into ffxiv after a very long break! i'm a level 46 paladin now, and i'm making my way through the msq bit by bit. i just got to coerthas, a region i immediately fell in love with. i'm such a sucker for video game snow.

### [roadwarden](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1155970/Roadwarden/)

picked this up from the steam winter sale and then played it for four hours straight until i had a headache from reading a lot tiny video game text on my steam deck in the dark without moving. it's so good. text-based witcher vibes. very cozy, and just the right level of difficulty for me imo.
