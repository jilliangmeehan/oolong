## building this!

i'm working on slowly rebuilding [my website](https://jillian.cloud) from scratch with [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), and keeping track of my progress on the [log](/log) page.

## learning languages

i'm keeping my [duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/jilliangmeehan) streak up again! making slow, steady progress in the mandarin course. i also played around a bit with the beginning of the greek course. i want to take a trip to france this year, so i should probably start practicing french again, too.
