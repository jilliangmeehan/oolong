## currently playing
- [NYT Games](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords) — I do the Mini, Wordle, and Connections. I really like Spelling Bee, but it's a huge time sink so I try to avoid it. I used to do Strands & Pips but don't really feel like it most days.
- [Tiled Words](https://tiledwords.com/) — This is such a nice twist on crossword puzzles.
- [Genshindle](https://us.genshindle.com/) — For the Hoyoverse sickos. I usually only do the Genshin ones, but if I'm really procrastinating I might throw in some HSR or ZZZ.
- [Clues by Sam](https://cluesbysam.com/) — This one really wakes my brain up.

## sometimes
- [Puzzmo](https://www.puzzmo.com/today) — I really like Puzzmo, but I don't do it every day. My favorite is Pile-Up Poker, but I also like their crosswords.
- [Bicross](https://smallandnearlysilent.com/bicross/daily/) — I've never been a huge picross person, but I feel like I've been seeing it everywhere lately so I'm giving it a try. [eli_oat](https://eli.li/) built this, and I love it. The only reason it's not always in my daily rotation is because there are six levels every day and I'm not very good at it yet, so it takes a while to get through them all.

## retired
- [Contexto](https://contexto.me/en/) — This one just frustrates me more often than not.
- [Bracket City](https://www.theatlantic.com/games/bracket-city/) — I like the concept, but the novelty wore off after a while.
