## currently playing
- [NYT Games](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords) — I do the Mini, Wordle, Connections, Strands, and Pips (the newest one!). I really like Spelling Bee, but it's a huge time sink so I try to avoid it.
- [Bracket City](https://www.theatlantic.com/games/bracket-city/) — Hard mode only!!!!
- [Genshindle](https://us.genshindle.com/) — For the Hoyoverse sickos. I usually only do the Genshin ones, but if I'm really procrastinating I might throw in some HSR or ZZZ.
- [Clues by Sam](https://cluesbysam.com/) — The newest addition to the roster. This one really wakes my brain up.

## sometimes
- [Puzzmo](https://www.puzzmo.com/today) — I really like Puzzmo, but I don't do it every day. My favorite is Pile-Up Poker, but I also like their crosswords.

## retired
- [Contexto](https://contexto.me/en/) — This one just frustrates me more often than not.
