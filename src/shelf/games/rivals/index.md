I avoided this game for a long time, but it finally happened to me. I'm still avoiding ranked for now, because I'm a little baby about it, but having a lot of fun in quick play. 

Mostly playing Strategist — Mantis, Invis, and Luna are my favs. Also trying to learn a couple Vanguards so I can be a little more flexible.
