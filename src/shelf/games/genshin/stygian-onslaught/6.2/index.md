This was probably the most fun I've had with Stygian Onslaught so far, although it was also the easiest to complete. It wasn't more fun because it took me less time to clear, but because there were so many ways I *could* have done it, so it didn't feel like you need to have certain characters.

Obviously, I did [the Jean thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlqFL-_qPLo&t=200s&pp=ygUWc3R5Z2lhbiBvbnNsYXVnaHQgamVhbg%3D%3D) for the Iktomisaurus, which I thought was very funny. It took me many tries to actually do the thing. More satisfying than learning any new Mavuika combo. 

With the Experimental Field Generator, my main goal was to hit the fabled 1m single strike with Flins — and I *did* do it, several times, but always died right after. So the best I got in my actual clear is 950k, which will have to do. It's so funny that this is possible, I love it.
