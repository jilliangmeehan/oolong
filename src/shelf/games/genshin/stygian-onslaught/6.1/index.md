My first sub-300s Fearless clear! I feel so good about it. 

My first plan was to use the Flins team for the Lightkeeper and then do the whole Crescent Pike Zhongli bit for Herra, but that turned out to be harder than I thought at this difficulty. Then I thought maybe I could come up with two separate electro-charged teams for Herra and the Lightkeeper, using Flins for one and Ineffa for the other. In the end, it was easier to just use the Flins team for Herra and spend my energy trying to brute force the Lightkeeper with Skirk.

It did take me a lot of tries to clear with the Skirk team. I tried swapping out Sigewinne for Yelan, since she was on the exalted list, but my Sigewinne is built better and is ultimately really good with this team — and things fall apart for me really quickly when I try to use Escoffier as a solo healer. In the end, putting Furina on a ToTM set is what finally did it.
