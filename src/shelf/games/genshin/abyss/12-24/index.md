## overview

In my first attempt using Dehya on the Chasca team, I only managed to get two stars for 12-1 and 12-3. And then when I went back in later and swapped Dehya for Pyro Lumine, I got the last two stars I was missing, but only got two stars for 12-2. I might go back and try to snag that last star with Lumine later, but at this point it's probably just a difference in blessings.

I think this is my first time clearing Floor 12 with Lumine! Very happy with Pyro Traveler so far. Builds for most of these characters are [here](https://enka.network/u/jillian/4CmScP/10000007/1426132/).
