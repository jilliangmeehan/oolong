![Shiyu Defense Overview](./photos/01-26_shiyu.png)

I'm getting back into ZZZ after being unexcited by it for a while. I think I tentatively like the new Shiyu Defense format, but I'm annoyed that they changed it so much instead of just improving on what it was or making it a new thing. We already have an endgame mode that's just this but harder, so I don't see the point.

That said, I had an easier time getting S-rank here than I usually did with the former seventh node, so I guess I'll take it.
