Long time no Shiyu Defense! I definitely did it at least a few times in the last few months, but I forgot to upload them, and Hoyolab only keeps records for the current & previous seasons. 

I had a lot of trouble with Seventh Frontier, mostly because I was unfamiliar with Miasma Isolde on the second half. Pulling Evelyn made it easier, but putting Yuzuha in there is what actually did it.
