## current goals
- Four large greenhouses on the expanded part of my farm (tea, wheat, rice, sugar cane)
	- It might make sense to start with four *small* greenhouses because the large ones are so expensive
- Larger orchard area to the left of my house
	- Row of each type of tree
- Small barn just for horses + large coop for rabbits & capybaras
	- Doesn't make sense to do this until I've finished unlocking all the skills from the Caldarus statue, because I would *really* need a steady supply of essence stones to keep up with caring for all the livestock
- +1 house upgrade
- Decorate the area in front of the Caldarus statue 

## essence stones
My eventual goal is to have essence stones powering my entire farm so I can spend all my time foraging, mining, and fishing. I know this will take a lot of essence stones, though — and I haven't finished unlocking all my skills yet, so right now, I'm just using essence stones in each barn/coop so I don't have to manually pet my livestock every day.

I'm thinking I'd need about:
- 4 for greenhouses
- 6 for seasonal crops
- 5 for coops & barns
- 5 for crops to feed livestock
- **20 total** essence stones

If I want to use giant essence stones, which last for 40 days, I'd need 1600 total stones and 4000 essence. Which is a crazy amount, but I'd have 40 whole days to get it for each cycle. 

Need to figure out how much stone + essence I tend to get on average when I spend a day mining to give me an idea of how many days I'd have to spend mining to maintain this. If it's unrealistic, I could maybe just not use essence stones for seasonal crops.
