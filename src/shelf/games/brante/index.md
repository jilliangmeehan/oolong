I'm fascinated by this game — it's exactly the kind of thing I'd like to build with [the little game engine I'm working on](https://jillian.garden/decadv/). 

I made it almost all of the way through peace time on my first run before dying a few times in quick succession. I had the option to go back and try to make different choices, but decided I'd rather just start over from the beginning and try again now that I have a better understanding of where everything goes.
