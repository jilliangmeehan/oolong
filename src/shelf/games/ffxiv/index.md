A few quests into Heavensward so far, trying to remember how to play this game with a controller. I will forever have a Returner badge.

## priorities
- Level one tank, ranged DPS, melee DPS, and healer to 50+
	- **Tank:** Paladin is my highest job so far (57), sort of leveling Dark Knight (40) on the side but not too concerned with it yet
	- **Ranged DPS:** Red Mage (55)
	- **Melee DPS:** Dragoon (36)
	- **Healer:** Astrologian (34)
- Try to level DoH/DoL jobs evenly — I just started with this, but there are a few jobs I still need to get started with
- Get my Grand Company rank to Flame Sergeant Second Class so I can finally sell all the unused gear sitting in my inventory
	- Mostly running around doing FATEs for this
	- I know I should start doing supply and provisioning missions more while I level my crafters & gatherers
