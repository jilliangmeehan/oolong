## overview
![Category Mistake](./photos/10-25_moc.png)

I'm posting this late, so I actually don't really remember what was going on here. I guess since it was pre-Cyrene, my solution for needing lots of ice damage was just to use The Herta *and* Evernight in a team together, which seems silly but I guess it worked.

I wasn't actually planning on pulling Evernight in the first place, but I accidentally pulled her light cone while trying to get The Herta's (devastating!) so...I figured I might as well get her so she could use it. And I definitely don't regret it, because she's been really good so far.

(I did end up getting The Herta's light cone too, don't worry.)
