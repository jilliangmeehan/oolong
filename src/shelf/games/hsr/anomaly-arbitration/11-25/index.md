## overview
![Anomaly Arbitration](./photos/11-25_aa.png)

I had a much easier time with this one than the last one — I went from not getting full stars on the knights to single cycling all of them, somehow. Obviously adding Cyrene and Hyacine to the lineup helped my Evernight team a lot, but my other two teams haven't really changed.

I've tried *so* many times to get two stars on the king, but I'm just not quite there. I've tried with both Tribbie and RMC in that slot and it's basically the same either way. I think the only thing that could tip me over the edge here is either Hyacine or Cyrene's signature light cone. I tried pulling for Hyacine's, but haven't gotten it yet, so I guess I'll take my high pity and keep trying to get Cyrene's before the version ends.
