## overview

Getting Hyacine and Cyrene has really breathed new life into my Mydei team. I had a lot of fun with him when he came out, but it got pretty hard to justify playing him in the most difficult content when I didn't have any of his best team members. 

My one struggle with the DoT team (still great!) is keeping them alive — Gallagher is a great healer, but all of these characters are so squishy compared to all the HP-scaling Amphoreus kids.
