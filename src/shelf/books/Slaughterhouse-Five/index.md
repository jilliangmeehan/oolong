First Vonnegut book I ever read. Made me want to laugh and cry so much.

## highlights
> I get drunk, and I drive my wife away with a breath like mustard gas and roses. And then, **speaking gravely and elegantly into the telephone**, I ask the telephone operators to connect me with this friend or that one, from whom I have not heard in years. <cite>Page 5</cite>

I can't get over the phrase *speaking gravely and elegantly into the telephone*.

> One end of the wallpaper was the beginning of the story, and the other end was the end, and then there was all that middle part, which was the middle. <cite>Page 6</cite>

> And I asked myself about the present: how wide it was, how deep it was, how much was mine to keep. <cite>Page 23</cite>

Sob.

> It is so short and jumbled and jangled, Sam, because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre. Everybody is supposed to be dead, to never say anything or want anything ever again. Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a massacre, and it always is, except for the birds. <cite>Page 24</cite>

> If what Billy Pilgrim learned from the Tralfamadorians is true, that we will all live forever, no matter how dead we may sometimes seem to be, I am not overjoyed. Still — if I am going to spend eternity visiting this moment and that, I'm grateful that so many of those moments are nice. <cite>Page 269</cite>
