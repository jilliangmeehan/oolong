Things I learned from reading this:
- If you are a king with three sons, just give the kingdom to the youngest and save everyone else the trouble.
- Always fill your backpack with food, not money, for the long journey ahead.
- If you are a princess with two sisters, you *will* all be abducted by three trolls with an increasing number of heads until a heroic third son comes along to save you by cutting off all the trolls' heads with their own giant swords. There is no escaping this fate.
- If a talking animal helps you on your quest, they are probably a cursed prince or princess. The only way to break the curse is to cut off their head.
- You are never going to make the king's daughter laugh with a cleverly-planned standup routine. Especially if you are not the youngest of three sons. Give up.
