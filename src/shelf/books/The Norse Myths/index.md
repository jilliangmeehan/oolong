I've been reading through [Kevin Crossley-Holland's retelling](https://50wattsbooks.com/products/the-norse-myths-the-pantheon-fairy-tale-and-folklore-library) of a bunch of classic Norse myths, most of which are brand new to me. The stories themselves are interesting, but I mostly enjoy flipping to the notes about each story in the back to learn more about the context surrounding them and how much we know (or don't know) about where they came from.
