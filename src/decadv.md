## 01
Today's goals: heat up some water and browse past [adventure logs](https://eli.li/december-adventure) for inspiration.

I've never ~~successfully~~ done any kind of monthly challenge. I like the idea of them, but intentional consistency is not my strong suit. The December Adventure feels more my speed — inching along with some kind of creative practice in whatever way feels meaningful to you each day. 

I have some ideas for what I might end up working on, but today I'm starting easy by getting this page up. Which, [thanks to an Obsidian plugin](https://jillian.garden/blog/using-obsidian-as-a-cms/), requires no code at all.
