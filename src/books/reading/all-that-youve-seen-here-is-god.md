i've been very into sophocles' _ajax_ lately since i first read it earlier this year. i've just been rereading the same pdf i found online after a quick google, so having a different & very well-considered version to read is nice. i spent christmas morning reading this _ajax_ and crying, lol.

i haven't read the other plays included here, but i'm excited to. i'm very interested in what bryan doerries does with his translations & the [theater of war](https://theaterofwar.com/) project.
