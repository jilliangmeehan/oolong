i've been looking forward to the release of this, and my parents got me a copy for christmas so i can finally read it. (i got her translation of the odyssey, too, but i'm going to save that one for later.) so far, i'm still making my way through her introduction & i'm excited to spend a lot of time with this.

my friend laura also got a copy, so i think we might read it together.
