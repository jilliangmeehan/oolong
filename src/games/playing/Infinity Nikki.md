I have had no interest in this game — I do have a lot of nostalgia for the dress-up games I used to play online as a kid, but not much interest in playing games like that as an adult. And I kept telling myself that I *really* do not need another open world gacha game in my life. And yet my curiosity won, and I started playing it on my Steam Deck. It runs surprisingly well, and I'm having more fun with it than I expected to. I realized that it's basically a game about my favorite part of most open world RPGs: gearing & leveling armor.
