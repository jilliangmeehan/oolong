i was ignoring this game for so long, and then i ended up checking it out at launch on a whim, and i've been enjoying it a lot. there are a ton of bugs and translation errors, and the launch was really rocky, but it's very fun nonetheless. i ended up getting jiyan, because he really grew on me in the main quest, and now i'm waiting for changli.
