I put off trying this game for a while, but I finally gave in this week, and I love it. The characters are all so fun and interesting, and they have so much dialogue! It's such a treat to walk up to someone and see that they have something new to say. And I love how much there is to discover about the history & lore of Mistria. I'm having a really hard time putting this one down.
