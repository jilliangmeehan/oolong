I'm playing this with Dylan, and it's pretty fun! The story is kinda corny and cringe, but it works because the two main characters are authors whose stories are also kinda corny and cringe. The game mechanics are cool and full of variety, and there are a bunch of cute little easter eggs that we like to find together.
