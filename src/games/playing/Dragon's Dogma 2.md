just started playing this and i'm having fun so far. my arisen is a fighter named perceval after the grail knight, and my main pawn is a mage named athelia. my favorite thing in this game is riding around in the oxcarts and just vibing.

update: this game is sick, i love it. i've been trying out fighter, thief, and warrior — all fun in their own ways, but i keep coming back to how satisfying it is to slowly swing a gigantic sword around as a warrior.
