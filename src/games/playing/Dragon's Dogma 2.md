i love this game. i unlocked the mystic spearhand vocation, and have been working on finishing up a bunch of side quests before i advance too much. i accidentally waited too long to save some lady's husband from a headless horseman, and now i have to go back to the city and tell her he was already dead when i got there — i was disappointed in myself at first, but then realized it was kind of fitting, since i named my character parsifal.
