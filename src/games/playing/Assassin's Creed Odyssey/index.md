I started playing this when AC: Shadows came out, because everyone was talking about the *new* game and I wanted to play it but figured I should start by playing one of the AC games I already have for free. This seemed like a good one to start with, and I'm already having a lot of fun. 

I obviously knew it was going to be a good game because this is a very successful franchise, but...it really is a good game! Crazy! I just like it a lot!
