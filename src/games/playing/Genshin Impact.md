lumine has been eating good lately: i finished crowning *all* of her skills for *all* of her elements, and i finally got her the aquila favonia she deserves. i also just recently got 36 stars in spiral abyss for the first time — i'm a real gamer now.

very much looking forward to arlecchino and everything to come in the next version. for now, i'm working on trying to get all the commission-based achievements i'm still missing & finding the last few seelies in each region that somehow managed to hide from me.
