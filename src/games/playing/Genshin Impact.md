something nobody tells you about being a completionist is that eventually you're going to really need primogems for something, and there will be none for you to get because your map is already at 100% and you've done all the achievement hunting you can do. right now, i'm doing my absolute best to scrape up whatever i can in the hopes of getting arlecchino's scythe before her banner ends. wish me luck pls.
