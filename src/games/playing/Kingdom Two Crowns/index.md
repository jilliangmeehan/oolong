I finished Norse Lands! It took me three deaths because of my proclivity to take everything really slowly and build up each island as much as possible before moving onto the next one — I learned my lesson.

I cleared the greed on all six islands, but I didn't do *everything*. There are a few mounts on earlier islands that I didn't get the chance to unlock because I didn't have enough diamonds, and by the time I did have enough, I didn't feel like going back to get them. The water horse carried me most of the game until I got the blue wolf.

I also didn't unlock Loki's staff on the last island — I couldn't figure out how to, and by the time I finally looked it up I was about to finish clearing all the greed anyway, so it didn't really matter anymore.

Perfect Steam Deck game, imo. I played through the Call of Olympus DLC, which I loved, and now I'm working on the Norse Lands DLC. Don't ask me why I'm working backwards — I'll finish the base game at some point.
