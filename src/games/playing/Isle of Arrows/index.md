Neat little tower defense game with daily challenges that are sometimes easy and sometimes impossible. I actually lost sleep playing this on my phone when I first tried it, but now I just pick it up a couple times a week to do the Daily Defense when I need something to do on my phone that isn't doomscrolling.
