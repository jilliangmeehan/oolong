## ui changes
- [Custom Menu Background](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7416): I love keeping this on the random setting and getting a totally different menu background every time I boot up the game.
- [Script Font](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11040): Pretty font! Probably harder to read, but pretty!
- [Dialogue Box Redesign](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8853): Removes the dialogue box in favor of floating dialogue text & character portraits, so you can see more of the screen while talking to someone. This one isn't super important to me, but I do like it.
- [Portraited Changing Skies](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/23337): Obviously incomptabile with the dialogue box redesign aboveâ€‰â€”â€‰I've never used this, but adding the current weather conditions to the character portraits is such a cute idea! I'll probably try both this + the other dialogue box redesign and see which one I like more.

## qol features
- [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098): Really useful if you play with any mods that have configuration options.
- [NPC Map Locations](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/239): I can't be bothered to remember all the NPC schedules, so it's nice to be able to see where they are on the minimap if I need to find someone.
- [Deluxe Journal](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11436): I love to-do lists in video games. I've never used this mod before, but I'm excited to give it a try.
- [Daily screenshot](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4779): Saves automatic screenshots of your farm at configurable intervalsâ€‰â€”â€‰I'm not sure how well this will work when I play on my Steam Deck, but I'd like to try setting it up to take weekly or monthly screenshots so I can look back and see the progression of my farm.

## recolors & retextures
- [DaisyNiko's Earthy Recolor](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5255): I have nothing against the look of vanilla Stardew, but this is a lot easier on the eyes to me. There are a lot of pretty nice-looking map recolors, but this is the one I tend to go for because it's been extended to the interiors, minimaps, and game UI so everything feels nice and cohesive.

- [Vibrant Pastoral Redrawn](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6367): Another nice recolor that I'm considering! This one is a little bit closer to vanilla Stardew, and it also covers interiors and minimaps in the same mod, so it seems like it'd be a simpler option. I like that it adds some seasonal holiday decor, too.
- [Simple Foliage](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/8164) + [1.6 update](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20972): Just some retextures that I like for trees and bushes and stuff. It supports a bunch of recolors, including the two I listed above.

## buildings
- [Some Building Edits - Seasonal](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/28220): Slightly different versions of all the farm buildings, with some cute seasonal decorations.

## animals
- Elle's Cuter Animals: I've always liked Elle's animal sprites and how many different options there are so you can get the *exact* kind of cat or horse or duck or whatever you want. These seem to be new versions of the old mods that have something to do with a 1.6 "skins" feature that I don't know anything about, so I guess I'll try them out and see what happens.
	- [Barn Animals](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20044)
	- [Coop Animals](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20043)
	- [Horses](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20042)
	- [Cats](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20041)
	- [Trinkets](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/27305)

## characters
- [Seasonal Outfits](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5450): This mod gives all the NPCs a bunch of new outfits so they can wear seasonally-appropriate or festival-specific clothes, in both the sprites and portraits.
- [Nyapu's Portraits](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11491) + [Seasonal Outfits](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/22938): Some very cute character portraits that I like, plus some additions that work with the seasonal outfits mod above.
- [Ohodavi's Anime Portraits](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1839) + [Seasonal Outfits](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/22876): This is another portrait option I likeâ€‰â€”â€‰less cutesy than the Nyapu one.

## item sprites
- [DSHi Item Retextures](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/birDfiSHi/mods?gameId=1303): Stardew's item sprites are already fine imo, but these ones look pretty nice tooâ€‰â€”â€‰and I appreciate that they've done just about every item in the game, because I think if you're gonna use mods like this you might as well be as consistent as possible. It's kinda weird when some items look way different from others.
- [Lux's Sprites](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10035): These food sprites are gorgeous ðŸ˜­

## clothes
- [Fashion Sense](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9969): Usually required to install if you're gonna use any clothing or farmer appearance mods.
- [Shardust's Animated Hairstyles](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10294): So unnecessary but also so fun.
- [LooneyLuny Mods](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/LooneyLuny/mods?gameId=1303&page=1): Lots of very cute fashion mods that I haven't tried yet but might take a look at.
	- [Animated Cozy Scarf](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/31864)
	- [Basic Cape and Oversized Hood](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/31994)
	- [FFXIV Paladin Cape](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/31933): *"I created this for my friend so his Paladin oath could be extended to Stardew Valley."* (cute lol)
