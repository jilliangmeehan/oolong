I'm super, super, super excited for Amphoreus. I think 3.0 is going to be really up my alley, and all the characters that have been teased so far look really cool to me. I just pulled Sunday, but he doesn't have a lot to do on my account until we get some of those Remembrance characters, so right now I'm mostly working on my backlog — finally building Herta and Dr. Ratio and the new Clara I just got.
