i loved penacony so much. i'm sad to be saying goodbye, but happy to see the story wrapping up. i'm *really* into divergent universe right now, much more than any other simulated universe expansion so far. and i'm having such a fun time with super break teams — firefly, harmony tb, and gallagher are my favorites units right now. i was never interested in ruan mei, but i realize she's the best support i could get for that fourth slot, so i'm casually throwing warps her way.
