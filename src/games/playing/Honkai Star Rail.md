i got acheron and gallagher, and i'm excited about both of them — also trying to slowly build welt, because it's about time i did. *also* going to spend the rest of this patch trying to get luocha, who i deeply regret not pulling for sooner.

(i also started the 2.1 trailblaze mission, which seems very interesting so far. it takes me a while to get through these, but the penacony quest has been really cool, so i'm looking forward to finding out what's going on.)
