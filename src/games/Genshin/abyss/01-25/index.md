## overview

I used a randomizer to pick my teams for Floor 11, which is why they're so weird. It worked, though!

It makes me very happy to be able to clear Floor 12 with Lumine, so I'm going to keep trying to do it. Other than that, I don't really remember how these runs went because I'm uploading this pretty late. It was definitely on the easier side — I think most of my resets were on Floor 11.
