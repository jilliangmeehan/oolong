I *really* wanted to play a game like this one this week, so I'm glad I found it. Really neat little crafting game where the ingredients you gather to make your potions all take you in a certain direction on the map when you add them to your concoction — the goal is to go far enough in the right direction to hit a point where you can add the effects you want to whatever potion you're making, which you can then sell to people who come by your shop. I haven't played very much of it yet, but I think it'll be nice to pick up when I'm in the mood for something chill that doesn't need a ton of time or energy to be enjoyable.
