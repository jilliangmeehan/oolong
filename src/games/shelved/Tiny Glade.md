I tried the demo of this a while ago, and now the full version is out! Very cute sandbox game. It's fun to discover how you can combine walls and buildings and other objects to do something unexpected — like putting a few windows near each other and seeing a line of drying laundry appear between them. I also like that they have a [daily theme](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2198150/discussions/0/4844274022649610626/) if you want some inspiration.
