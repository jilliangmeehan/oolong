I normally shy away from shop management games like this because they tend to feel very chaotic and stressful — but this one has a few different difficulty levels, so you can choose to play at a cozier pace and just enjoy the process of building out your little coffee shop. I finished both the coffee and tea levels over a couple of days, and I might go back and give it another try on a higher difficulty. After that, I'll just be waiting for them to release the upcoming ice cream shop level.
