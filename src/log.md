## oct 4, 2025

- slightly tweaked styles for callouts and h3 

## sept 30, 2025

- added headers to game pages on the [shelf](/shelf) with cover art, links, statuses, and UIDs
- added collections for [hsr](https://jillian.garden/shelf/games/hsr/) endgame modes

## sept 29, 2025

- added a limit to how many of the most recent posts in a collection are displayed on a [shelf](/shelf) page (i still need to add a "see more" link or something, but you can get to the full collection pages via breadcrumbs for now if you click through)

## june 25, 2025

- added headers to book pages on the [shelf](/shelf) with cover art, authors, and statuses
- added styles for footnotes and callout blocks

## april 18, 2025

- updated the default opengraph image + opengraph tags
- updated styles for posts in lists
- added new post types for [shelf](/shelf) stuff (mostly games): journal & sticky notes

## april 4, 2025

- cleaned up the [shelf](/shelf) page a little by putting everything into tables & adding colored indicators for statuses
- ditched the old /now page and moved some of my past updates into their own weeknotes blog posts instead


## dec 18, 2024

- added links to the [shelf](/shelf) and [changelog](/log) to the footer
- added a [meta](/meta) page
- added a [style guide](/docs) page
- added breadcrumb navigation

## dec 15, 2024

- swapped in some new fonts: [artifex](https://connary.com/fonts/artifex/) & [departure mono](https://departuremono.com/)
- changed the way the [now](/now) page works: it used to be updated dynamically based on items in my collections that had an "in-progress" status (or something similar) — now it's just a single markdown file that i edit myself, which will be easier to manage & will let me save previous versions in another spot
- moved that dynamically updated stuff to a new page: the [shelf](/shelf) (this is still super in-progress)
- added markdown-it to automatically turn all my quotes & apostrophes into the curly versions, inspired by [anh](https://anhvn.com/posts/2022/markdown-optimizations/) (my computer has refused to type curly quotes for years. i do not know why. i have tried to fix it.)

## oct 25, 2024

- added a teacup easter egg (click it!)

## sept 27, 2024

- kinda just played around with the css

## jun 25, 2024

## mar 16, 2024

- added some fonts ([argent pixel](https://connary.com/argentpixel.html) & [addington](https://connary.com/addington.html) from connary fagen)

## mar 9, 2024

- figured out how to set up the [github publisher plugin](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher) to use obsidian as a cms
- imported all my existing [blog posts](/blog)

feeling good about this so far. i've had fun setting up the github project & planning out what i want to do. i want to keep everything as simple as possible for as long as i can, because it's all too easy for me to get myself bogged down with page templates and sass before i even have anything to work with.
