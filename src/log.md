## dec 15, 2024

- swapped in some new fonts: [artifex](https://connary.com/fonts/artifex/) & [departure mono](https://departuremono.com/)
- changed the way the [now](/now) page works: it used to be updated dynamically based on items in my collections that had an "in-progress" status (or something similar) — now it's just a single markdown file that i edit myself, which will be easier to manage & will let me save previous versions in another spot
- moved that dynamically updated stuff to a new page: the [shelf](/shelf) (this is still super in-progress)
- added markdown-it to automatically turn all my quotes & apostrophes into the curly versions, inspired by [anh](https://anhvn.com/posts/2022/markdown-optimizations/) (my computer has refused to type curly quotes for years. i do not know why. i have tried to fix it.)

## sept 27, 2024

## mar 9, 2024

- figured out how to set up the [github publisher plugin](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher) to use obsidian as a cms
- imported all my existing [blog posts](/blog)

- added & filled out the [/now](/now) page
- started setting up a few basic page layouts

feeling good about this so far. i've had fun setting up the github project & planning out what i want to do. i want to keep everything as simple as possible for as long as i can, because it's all too easy for me to get myself bogged down with page templates and sass before i even have anything to work with.
