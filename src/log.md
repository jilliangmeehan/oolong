### **dec 26, 2023**

- added this page!
- added actual content to the [home](/) page
- added the [/now](/now) page
- started setting up a few basic page layouts

feeling good about this so far. i've had fun setting up the github project & planning out what i want to do. i want to keep everything as simple as possible for as long as i can, because it's all too easy for me to get myself bogged down with page templates and sass before i even have anything to work with.
