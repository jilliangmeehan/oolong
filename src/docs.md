## misc notes

I would like to make & document some more thorough rules to follow here, but this is the best I've got for now. So here are some extra bits and pieces that I want to make a note of:

- I use a `6px` border radius for everything
- Headers and nav links are lowercase; body copy is sentence-case
- Links are underlined!!!
- **Unofficial rule:** I don't really like to put Argent Pixel & Departure Mono too close to each other if I can avoid it

### header rules

- `h1` uses Argent Pixel; everything else uses Departure Mono
- `h2` gets the `background-color: var(--oat);` treatment
- Headers are always lowercase

### things to fix

- I'm not super happy with how `h3` and below look
- Code needs a more readable font & actual syntax highlighting
- I do _not_ have a good system for font sizes at all
- I want to actually write down rules for which colors are used for what (some of them aren't even used for anything at all right now!)
