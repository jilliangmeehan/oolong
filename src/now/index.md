## learning greek
I'm keeping up my longest-ever [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/jilliangmeehan) streak with the Greek course. Learning new alphabets is fun!

## playing
### [Genshin Impact](../games/Genshin%20Impact/index.md)
Right now, I'm just really excited to finally get Pyro Lumine in a few weeks. I've already prefarmed all of the talent books that I'll need to triple crown her, and I'm working on getting her an Obsidian Codex set that doesn't suck. 

### [Zenless Zone Zero](../games/playing/Zenless%20Zone%20Zero/index.md)
Miyabi and Harumasa are both so fun to play. She doesn't need it to be good, but I'm really hoping I can get Miyabi's w-engine soon (and then I'll be good and save for Astra Yao). I also really like the new Hollow Zero mode — although as I was doing some old HDD commissions recently, I was thinking about how much I actually *do* like TV mode and don't want them to abandon it. 

In preparation for 1.4 coming out, I've spent some time this week catching up on quests and video tapes and finding all the HIA commemorative coins and stuff. I still have plenty left to do (I haven't finished Koleda or Burnice's video tapes yet, and I've got a small pile of HDD commissions waiting for me), but I'm proud of my progress. And it feels good to be "caught up" on a game.

### [Infinity Nikki](../games/playing/Infinity%20Nikki/index.md)
I have had no interest in this game — I do have a lot of nostalgia for the dress-up games I used to play online as a kid, but not much interest in playing games like that as an adult. And I kept telling myself that I *really* do not need another open world gacha game in my life. 

And yet my curiosity won, and I started playing it on my Steam Deck. It runs surprisingly well, and I'm having more fun with it than I expected to. I realized that it's basically a game about my favorite part of most open world RPGs: gearing & leveling armor.

### [FFXIV](../games/playing/FFXIV/index.md)
I finally finished A Realm Reborn (for real this time!) and started Heavensward. I've been having a good time as a Paladin, but I'm taking this opportunity to pause for a bit and try out some other jobs — Dark Knight is another favorite of mine, so far, but I'm trying to dip my toes into some healer & DPS jobs too. 

### [Honkai Star Rail](../games/playing/Honkai%20Star%20Rail/index.md)
I'm super, super, super excited for Amphoreus. I think 3.0 is going to be really up my alley, and all the characters that have been teased so far look really cool to me. I just pulled Sunday, but he doesn't have a lot to do on my account until we get some of those Remembrance characters, so right now I'm mostly working on my backlog — finally building Herta and Dr. Ratio and the new Clara I just got.

I'm also trying to catch up on the story before 3.0 comes out, because I've been lagging behind a bit. I still need to finish the Wardance story, and I just started the whole Slumbernana Monkey thing. I'm honestly having kind of a hard time getting through some of it, but I'm excited to get to the newer Sunday quest.
