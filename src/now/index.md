## learning greek
I'm keeping up my longest-ever [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/jilliangmeehan) streak with the Greek course. Learning new alphabets is fun!

## playing
### [Genshin Impact](../games/Genshin%20Impact/index.md)
Right now, I'm just really excited to finally get Pyro Lumine in a few weeks. I've already prefarmed all of the talent books that I'll need to triple crown her, and I'm working on getting her an Obsidian Codex set that doesn't suck. 

### [Infinity Nikki](../games/playing/Infinity%20Nikki/index.md)
I have had no interest in this game — I do have a lot of nostalgia for the dress-up games I used to play online as a kid, but not much interest in playing games like that as an adult. And I kept telling myself that I *really* do not need another open world gacha game in my life. And yet my curiosity won, and I started playing it on my Steam Deck. It runs surprisingly well, and I'm having more fun with it than I expected to. I realized that it's basically a game about my favorite part of most open world RPGs: gearing & leveling armor.

### [FFXIV](../games/playing/FFXIV/index.md)
I finally finished A Realm Reborn (for real this time!) and started Heavensward. I've been having a good time as a Paladin, but I'm taking this opportunity to pause for a bit and try out some other jobs — Dark Knight is another favorite of mine, so far, but I'm trying to dip my toes into some healer & DPS jobs too. 

### [Honkai Star Rail](../games/playing/Honkai%20Star%20Rail/index.md)
I'm super, super, super excited for Amphoreus. I think 3.0 is going to be really up my alley, and all the characters that have been teased so far look really cool to me. I just pulled Sunday, but he doesn't have a lot to do on my account until we get some of those Remembrance characters, so right now I'm mostly working on my backlog — finally building Herta and Dr. Ratio and the new Clara I just got.

### [Zenless Zone Zero](../games/playing/Zenless%20Zone%20Zero/index.md)
I love Lighter. What a guy. Nothing else to say, really.
