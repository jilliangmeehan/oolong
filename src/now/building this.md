i'm working on slowly rebuilding [my website](https://jillian.cloud) from scratch with [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), and keeping track of my progress on the [log](/log) page. i'm getting a little more comfortable with the process, i've started adding more collections of content, and i just recently got around to writing some really scuffed css to make it a bit nicer to look at.
