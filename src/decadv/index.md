# December Adventure
> The December Adventure is **low key**. <cite><a href="https://eli.li/december-adventure">eli_oat</a></cite>  

## 01
I've never ~~successfully~~ done any kind of monthly challenge. I like the idea of them, but intentional consistency is not my strong suit. The December Adventure feels more my speed — inching along with some kind of creative practice in whatever way feels meaningful to you each day. 

Today's goals: heat up some water and browse past [adventure logs](https://eli.li/december-adventure) for inspiration.

Cleaned my apartment in the hopes of feeling more productive tomorrow.

I got back into a little project I've been working on here and there for a few months, born out of my want for something [Twine](https://twinery.org/)-y but simpler. What I've ended up making is a tool that turns a markdown file into interactive fiction. 

I've had most of it sort of working for a while, but today I finally added some variable interpolation — so now you can do a liiiittle more than just jump between text passages based on player choices.

I'll probably end up working on this for most of December Adventure, although I do have a few other projects in mind that I could pick up.
