<article><p>I’m going to copy <a href="https://anhvn.com/posts/2023/weeknotes-revival/">Anh</a> — I’ve been thinking about <a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2018/07/24/weeknotes">weeknotes</a> lately, and about why I don’t write here very often, and about how I could change that. It’s easier not to write than to write, and writing in public is a little humiliating in a way that private journaling escapes. But I’ve managed to build up the habit of journaling, so maybe I can do this, too.</p>
<p>I go back and forth on this: I sometimes feel annoying and useless taking up space “<a href="https://sleepy.cool/@jillian/111387332195020722">on-line</a>,” like I’m whining and begging everyone to <em>look at me! I’m here!</em> — like the only way I’m allowed to post is to share something interesting I worked on, and the rest of me has to live in the shadows.</p>
<p>But I know that’s not true. I know that I like to fill my feeds with tiny life updates and silly thoughts from people I follow, even people that I barely know at all. I love when <a href="https://sleepy.cool/@jillian/111356009288566081">I have no idea what anyone is talking about</a>. I love browsing <a href="https://ooh.directory/">ooh.directory</a> for blogs I never would have known existed, and filling my rss feed with inconsequential posts that nonetheless make me happy to read. I want more of that, so maybe I have to be part of making more of that.</p>
<h2>what i’ve been up to</h2>
<p>I’ve been sketching more — in an actual sketchbook, with actual pens and pencils. I like doodling in Procreate, but something about sketching on paper feels better. Even though it’s harder to correct things I’m not happy with, and even though I have far less freedom &amp; flexibility with materials, I like what I make in my sketchbook far more than anything I make on my iPad.</p>
<p><img src="./photos/_10-sketches.jpg" alt="my sketchbook"></p>
<p>Because of that, and because we’re nearing the end of the year, I’ve been thinking a lot about notebooks and planners. I still haven’t decided if I want a new Hobonichi for next year or if I want to try something else. I really don’t need a planner, much less a daily one, but I still <em>like</em> having them. I do have some idea of what my ideal notebook would be, and the modularity of <a href="https://travelerscompanyusa.com/travelers-notebook-story/">the Traveler’s Notebook</a> comes pretty close — so I might try that out.</p>
<h2>watching</h2>
<p>After years of curiosity, I started watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3006802/">Outlander</a> on Halloween — which was kind of perfect, because the first episode takes place on Samhain. I immediately loved the vibes. I’ve watched about half of the first season, and I’ll probably continue watching it for a bit, but I don’t know if i’ll be able to hang on for seven seasons.</p>
<p>I also saw <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1136617/">The Killer</a>, which I didn’t think was very good. It definitely looked &amp; felt &amp; sounded like a Fincher movie, but the story was lacking compared to everything else he’s done. I would rather just rewatch The Social Network for the 300th time.</p>
<h2>playing</h2>
<p>Genshin’s 4.2 patch just came out, and I stayed up embarrassingly late to play the entire Archon Quest in one night after pulling for Furina and her weapon. I’ve <em>really</em> loved the whole Fontaine arc, and I think Act V wrapped it up so well — Furina is easily my favorite archon.</p>
<p><img src="./photos/_10-furina.png" alt="furina chilling by the weeping willow"></p>
<p>And to brag for a second: I managed to get 100% exploration on the existing Fontaine map before 4.2 was released, I got the Fontaine wings, and I also finally hit 1000 achievements this week. I have really played a stupid amount of this game.</p>
<p>As for the other Hoyoverse games, I finished the latest Trailblaze Mission in Honkai: Star Rail last night, just a few days away from a new update. And I finally started Honkai Impact: 3rd this week — so far, I have no idea what I’m doing, but the story is really interesting to me. I wanna know the lore!!!</p>
<h2>reading</h2>
<p>I just reread Sophocles’ <a href="https://classics.domains.skidmore.edu/lit-campus-only/primary/translations/Sophocles%20Ajax.pdf">Ajax</a>, a play I never expected to love as much as I do. I feel like every time I read it, I get something new out of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Skamander river <br>
hostile to the Greeks,<br>
there is one man your water<br>
will not mirror<br>
again</p>
<p>(<a href="https://classics.domains.skidmore.edu/lit-campus-only/primary/translations/Sophocles%20Ajax.pdf">Ajax</a>, Sophocles)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/believing-in-believing-in-people">An issue of Spencer Chang’s newsletter</a> from all the way back in February made its way into my queue recently, and I really loved reading it. Makes me want to be a more curious, friendly, open person.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to believe in people. I want to believe that I still believe in people.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/believing-in-believing-in-people">believing in believing in people</a>, Spencer Chang)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve also been thinking + reading a lot about chess lore recently:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bookriot.com/chess-in-literature/">chess in literature</a></li>
<li><a href="https://daily.jstor.org/chess-unlike-war-is-a-game-of-perfect-information/">chess, unlike war, is a game of perfect information</a></li>
<li><a href="https://victorianweb.org/authors/bronte/abronte/chess.html">the development of the chess motif in victorian fiction</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/public/articles/The_Symbolism_of_Chess-by_Titus_Burckhardt.aspx">the symbolism of chess</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.chess.com/forum/view/chess-equipment/scash-darmor-english-translation">scash d’armor</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all. Happy Friday. Going to go make another cup of tea and clean my apartment.</p>
