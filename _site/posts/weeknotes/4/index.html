<article><p>Two days until work starts up again — at this point I’m grateful for it, because I think I really need to just get back into my normal routines. And to remember that time flows normally even after vacation ends, because my brain keeps tricking me into thinking that I need to do <em>everything</em> I’ve <em>ever</em> wanted to do before Monday or I will run out of time and lose the chance to do any of it ever again. Silly!</p>
<h2>what i’ve been up to</h2>
<p>I went home to see my family for Christmas; had a good time hanging out there for the week eating cookies and playing Uno. I came back to Brooklyn to see friends and make New Year’s Even plans — which turned out to be very chill. Dylan and I hung out with a small group of friends and drank wine while we played video games until midnight.</p>
<h2>reading</h2>
<p>I spent an entire day reading <a href="https://readonlymemory.com/shop/book/500-years-2nd-edition/">500 Years Later: An Oral History of Final Fantasy VII</a>, which was pretty cool. It was less about the game itself and more about the business &amp; management stuff happening at Square at the time, told through interviews with a bunch of the people involved before, during, and after the game launched. Really made me want to go back and play more of it!</p>
<p>I also just got a copy of <a href="https://50wattsbooks.com/products/the-norse-myths-the-pantheon-fairy-tale-and-folklore-library">The Norse Myths</a> retold by Kevin Crossley-Holland, and I’ve been making my way through it. I like having a bunch of these stories in a collection together that I can flip through, and there’s a lot of extra context in the introduction &amp; the footnotes for each story, so I’m learning a lot. 50 Watts has a bunch of other collections in the same <a href="https://50wattsbooks.com/search?q=pantheon+folk">“Pantheon Fairy Tale and Folklore Library”</a> series, and I’d like to pick up more of them once I finish this one.</p>
<h2>watching</h2>
<p>I didn’t watch any Christmas movies this year! I always kinda forget to when I’m not with my family, and they watch them all early anyway. I’m in the mood for a Phantom Thread rewatch soon, though — it’s a holiday movie in my heart if not in reality.</p>
<p>My family and I usually like to watch comedy specials on Netflix when I’m home. This year we went for the newest Nate Bargatze one, and a couple of Tom Papa’s. And when I got back to New York, Dylan and I started watching the new season of Squid Game, which we’re a few episodes into so far.</p>
<h2>playing</h2>
<p>Both <a href="../../../games/Genshin%20Impact/index.html">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="../../../games/playing/Wuthering%20Waves/index.html">Wuthering Waves</a> had updates this week, and <a href="../../../games/playing/Honkai%20Star%20Rail/index.html">Honkai Star Rail</a> has a big update coming up soon, so I’ve naturally been playing a lot of those. I’m also still playing a lot of <a href="../3/index.html">Kingdom: Two Crowns</a> — I finished the Call of Olympus DLC and started Norse Lands, to go along with the book I’m reading.</p>
<p>The big news is I just realized I can play Dragon’s Dogma 2 again, after not being able to get it to open for months. It’s not really a great time to sink my teeth back into a game like that, because I’ve got plenty of other things I wanted to do, but I can’t help myself. I’m going to try to remember how the controls work today so I can pick up where I left off with the main story.</p>
<h2>footnote</h2>
<p>I’m happy with the changes I made to my<a href="/now"> /now</a> page recently, and I’m happy to actually be updating it &amp; writing weeknotes more often, but it does feel a little silly to me that I’m essentially writing the same thing in two places at the same time. They’re not <em>exactly</em> the same, but there’s a good amount of overlap. I don’t know what I wanna do about that…or if I really care to do anything about it at all. Maybe it’s fine! Whatever!</p>
