## what is oolong?

- partially-oxidized tea, falls btwn black & green tea
- there’s a legend that it was discovered by accident by a man who forgot about his tea because he got distracted by a deer (adhd king)
- i like the idea of it representing an in-between state — a website that’s not too light, but not too serious
- i also like the idea of “brewing” the website to your taste — different themes & fonts, things to play around with, places to leave notes#
